## üß© Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)**:  This is essential for communication between your computer and your Android device.
  - **Download Platform Tools**: Get the latest ADB binaries from [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).
  - **Add ADB to PATH**:  Make ADB accessible system-wide by adding the downloaded `platform-tools` directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable. This allows you to run `adb` commands from any terminal location.

- **USB Debugging Enabled on Android Device**: You must enable USB Debugging in your Android device's developer options.
  - **Enable Developer Options**: Go to "Settings" > "About phone" (or similar) and tap "Build number" repeatedly (usually 7 times) until "Developer options" are enabled.
  - **Enable USB Debugging**: Navigate to "Settings" > "Developer options" and toggle on "USB debugging".

- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running the application from source. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it installed.

## üíª Installation & Usage

**For the most stable experience, it is recommended to run Android Debloater directly from the Python source code.** This ensures you are using the most up-to-date version and can sometimes avoid issues related to platform-specific builds.

### Running from Source (Recommended)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oop7/Android-debloater.git
cd Android-debloater
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**:
```bash
python ABDLT.py
```
### Pre-built Executables (Alternative)

If you prefer a standalone executable for convenience, you can download pre-compiled versions for your operating system from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/oop7/Android-debloater/releases) on GitHub:

- **Windows**: Download the `.exe` executable.
- **macOS**: Download the `.dmg` disk image.
- **Linux**: Download the `.AppImage` file.

Simply download the appropriate file for your system and run it. While these executables offer ease of use, please note:

- **Potential Compatibility Issues**: Pre-built executables might encounter platform-specific issues that are less likely when running directly from the Python source code.
- **Slightly Delayed Updates**: Executable releases might lag behind the most recent source code updates.

**For the most robust and up-to-date experience, running from source (as described in the "Running from Source (Recommended)" section above) is still the preferred method.**  However, if you prioritize simplicity and a quick start, the pre-built executables offer a convenient alternative.

### Basic Usage Guide (Applies to both Source and Executables)

1. **Connect Your Android Device**:
   - Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device (as per the [Requirements](#-requirements) section).
   - You might be prompted on your device to authorize USB debugging from your computer - **allow this connection**.

2. **Launch Android Debloater**:
   - Run the Android Debloater application (either by executing `python ADBLT.py` from source or launching the downloaded executable).

3. **Verify Device Connection**:
   - In the application's interface, check the "Connected Devices" section. Your device should be listed, indicating a successful ADB connection. If no device is listed, ensure ADB is correctly installed and your device is properly connected with USB debugging enabled. Try clicking the "Refresh Devices" button.

4. **Scan for Packages**:
   - Click the "**Scan for Installed Packages**" button. The application will use ADB to retrieve a list of all packages installed on your device. This process may take a moment.

5. **Search and Filter Packages**:
   - Use the **search bar** at the top to filter the package list. Type keywords to quickly find specific packages or types of applications you are looking for.

6. **Explore Package Information Online**:
   - **Right-click** on any package in the list.
   - Select "**Search Online**" from the context menu.
   - Your default web browser will open, performing a Google search for information about the selected package. This is a powerful way to understand what a package is and whether it is safe to remove.

7. **Select Packages for Uninstallation**:
   - **Select the checkboxes** next to the packages you wish to uninstall. You can select multiple packages for batch uninstallation. **Exercise caution** and research packages before removing them, especially system applications.

8. **Uninstall Selected Packages**:
   - Click the "**Uninstall Selected**" button.
   - A confirmation dialog will appear. **Carefully review your selections** before confirming the uninstallation process.
   - Click "**Yes**" to proceed with uninstallation. The application will use ADB to uninstall the selected packages one by one, showing progress in the status bar.

9. **Reboot Device (Optional)**:
    - After uninstalling packages, especially system apps, it's often recommended to reboot your device for changes to fully take effect.
    - Click the "**Reboot Device**" button to initiate a device reboot via ADB.
